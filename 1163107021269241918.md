A digital artwork poster features the word "EUROPA" prominently at the bottom with the subtitle "DISCOVER LIFE UNDER THE ICE" and a tagline "ALL OCEAN VIEWS!!!" below it. The image showcases a massive, bioluminescent octopus-like creature with swirling tentacles, illuminated from within by glowing blue and white spots, emerging from a hole in an icy expanse. An astronaut is depicted floating near its tentacles. Below, silhouetted figures of three people – two adults and a child – stand observing the scene. The third figure on the right appears to be wearing a hat. The icy landscape is bathed in varying shades of blue, suggesting a cold, underwater environment, with rays of light penetrating the icy depths above. The image evokes a sense of mystery and exploration.
